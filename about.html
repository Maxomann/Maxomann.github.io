I started programming ~4 years ago. My first programs were console applications written in C++. Since then I have been continously extending my knowledge in various programming languages including C++(Windows), Java(Android) and Javascript. My current project is a component based 2d game engine in C++. You can find out more about it <a href="kgEngine.html#article">here</a>. Furthermore I made this website using HTML/CSS and Javascript. As for the IDE I use VisualStudio for C++ and VisualBasic.NET and AndroidStudio for app development. You can view the source of some of my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/Maxomann">Github page</a>.

			Besides programming I like to create 2d designs and 3d models. I am experienced in using Photoshop, Illustrator and Cinema 4D. You can find more 2d and 3d works in the <a href="gallery.html#article">gallery</a>.
