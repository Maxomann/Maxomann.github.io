    <p>
        I started programming ~4 years ago. My first programs were console applications written in C++. Since then I have been continously extending my knowledge in various programming languages including C++(Windows), Java(Android) and Javascript.
        My current project is a component based 2d game engine in C++. You can find out more about it <a href="kgEngine.html">here</a>. Furthermore I made this website using HTML/CSS and Javascript.
        As for the IDE I use VisualStudio for C++ and VisualBasic.NET and AndroidStudio for app development.<br/> You can view the source of some of my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/Maxomann">Github page</a>.
